This folder is organized in the following way:

- data folder: contains normalized transcriptome data and swarm properties for plotting

- swarmProperties_calculation folder: Contains the Matlab code used to calculate properties.
Note, that this code can only be executed in connection with raw data that is organized in a 
specific folder structure (see description within the swarmProperties_calculation folder)

- creatHeatmap: A function to plot heatmaps as displayed in the paper, SI and online viewer. 
Two examples on how to use this function are given in:

- exmaple_plotGenes: Example script to plot specific genes

- example_plotSwarmProperties: Example script to splot specific swarm properties
